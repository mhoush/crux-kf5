WARNING!!!

In order to build this port, you need to rebuild qt5 with wayland-protocols
installed.
Run the following command:

   prt-get depinst wayland-protocols && prt-get update -fr qt5

Note that this isn't sufficient to have a wayland desktop, since you'd need to
rebuild mesa3d adding "wayland to the -Dplatforms switch.

Also note that's very likely that other ports need to be adjusted to enable
full wayland support on KDE. I haven't tested it.
