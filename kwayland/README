WARNING!!!

In order to build this port, you need to rebuild qt5 with wayland-protocols
installed.

Note that this isn't sufficient to have a wayland desktop, since you'd need to
rebuild mesa3d adding "wayland to the -Dplatforms switch.

See Tim Biermann's mesa3d port with optional wayland dependency:
https://github.com/TimB87/crux-wayland/blob/master/mesa3d/Pkgfile
